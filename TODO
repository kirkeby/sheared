 * Implement .block_on(object) and .notify_on(object) greenlet signalling
   primitives in the reactor-core, and implement full grennlet comunication
   channels on top of that.

 * Split reactor into EventLoop (i.e. low-level I/O and timeout primitives,
   for implementing reactors) and Reactor (i.e. the greenlet primitives).

 * Documentation is badly needed; both as doc-strings, as HOWTOs, and as more
   traditional book-like ramblings.
