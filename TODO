 * Implement full greenlet comunication channels on top of .{block,notify}_on.

 * Split reactor into EventLoop (i.e. low-level I/O and timeout primitives,
   for implementing reactors) and Reactor (i.e. the greenlet primitives).

 * Documentation is badly needed; both as doc-strings, as HOWTOs, and as more
   traditional book-like ramblings.
